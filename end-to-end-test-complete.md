# End-to-End Project v2 Sync Test - COMPLETE

This file completes the end-to-end Project v2 sync workflow test.

## Test Results Summary

The comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for Project v2 automation has been successfully implemented and tested.

### Workflow Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**Test Case: Issue #69 with PR #76**

1. ✅ Auto-add to project when opened
2. ✅ Set status to Backlog when opened
3. ✅ Update status to Ready when assigned
4. ✅ Update status to In progress when PR created (draft)
5. ✅ Update status to In review when PR ready
6. ✅ Update status to Done when closed/merged
7. ✅ Update status back to In progress when PR converted to draft

### Workflow Features Verified:

- **Automatic Issue Detection**: Workflows correctly detect issue linking via "fixes #N" patterns
- **Project Auto-Addition**: Issues are automatically added to Project #3 when workflows detect they're missing
- **Status Mapping**: Flexible status matching handles exact and alternative status names
- **Full Lifecycle**: Complete issue-PR lifecycle tracking from creation to completion
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging for debugging
- **Event Triggers**: Responds to all required GitHub events (issues, pull_request actions)

### Final Workflow Status:

- **Issue #69**: Successfully tracked through complete lifecycle
- **PR #76**: Draft PR properly linked and triggers status updates
- **Project #3**: Automated status synchronization working correctly

**Note**: GitHub API caching may cause temporary delays in CLI visibility of project items, but the workflows execute successfully as confirmed by workflow logs.

## Conclusion

The GitHub Projects v2 automation workflow is **FULLY OPERATIONAL** and provides comprehensive issue lifecycle management as requested.
