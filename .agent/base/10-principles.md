# Core Principles

P-1: Minimize risk via incremental, reviewable changes.
P-2: Prefer clarity over cleverness.
P-3: Ask before large impact (see R-PRC-020 thresholds).
P-4: Security posture is proactive: never introduce silent data exposure.
P-5: Tests are contract guardians; new or changed behavior ⇒ tests.
P-6: Document only what is non‑obvious or externally consumed.
P-7: Make thresholds explicit and measurable (diff stats, file counts, path scopes).
