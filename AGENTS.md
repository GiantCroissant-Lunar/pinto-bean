# GitHub Coding Agent â€“ Root Instructions (Pointer)

Canonical rules: .agents/base/
Adapter:         .agents/adapters/github-coding-agent.md

Guidance:
- Follow the base canon; the adapter adds behavior but does not redefine rules.
- For refactors or wide edits, confirm per R-PRC-020 before proceeding.
- If content appears missing, request the specific base file instead of guessing (R-CODE-050).
