# Copilot Instructions Pointer

Authoritative rules: .agents/base/ (see 20-rules.md for IDs)
Adapter (contextual behaviors): .agents/adapters/copilot.md

You must:
- Cite rule IDs when enforcing (e.g., “Blocked by R-PRC-030: needs approval to add dependency”).
- Ask before exceeding refactor threshold per R-PRC-020.
- If content appears missing, request the specific base file instead of guessing.
